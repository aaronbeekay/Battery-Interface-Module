Changelog - Battery Interface Module

# v1.0.0 (r01)
Initial version.

# v1.0.1 (r02)
Bugfixes.

# v2.0.0
BIM v2 is a redesign for RW-3.

## Major changes
* Redesign to be a 24-cell monitor (not 36).
* Remove onboard balancing circuit.
* Remove CAN auto-termination circuit and replace with termination switch.
* Updated CAN communications circuit for improved robustness to electromagnetic noise.
* Reduce size and height to integrate with RW-3 battery pack.

## Detailed changelog
* Update per-cell filter circuit to improve performance.
* Remove one digital isolator -- no longer pass CONV, DRDY, FAULT, ALERT to host processor.
* Update CAN circuit to use ISO1050 and add common-mode choke.
* Change CAN/power connector to M12 circular connector.
* Reduce power loss capacitance from 1000 uF to 200 uF.
* Include series resistance in VBAT lines to '536A ICs in order to mitigate hot-plug inrush current device destruction issue.
* Include per-cell Zener diodes before low-pass filter.
* New form factor and mounting.
* Added pogo-pin test points to improve debugging accessibility.
* Call out commonly modified components (stack communication components, stack termination components) on silkscreen layer for convenience.
* Reduce use of 0402-size components and eliminate 0402-size resistor arrays for reliability when hand soldered.
* Remove CAN auto-termination circuit, add switch to terminate CAN.
* Add "CAN-TX" LED. Remove one CPU-controlled LED.
* Remove both pushbuttons.
* Remove both pushbutton indicator lights.
* JTAG header is now 0.05" pitch.
* Add separate +5V rail to power SN65HVD1050 (CAN transceiver).

#v2.0.1
* Increase test point text size for legibility.

# v2.0.2
* Pull n-HSEL lines to n-LDOD instead of n-REG50 (resolves wake-from-sleep communications issue #7).
