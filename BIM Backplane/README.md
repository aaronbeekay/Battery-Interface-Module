# README - BIM Backplane

The BIM Backplane is a PCB that allows three Battery Interface Modules to be connected together on their low-voltage interfaces. It busses their CAN ports together and allows for any of the three devices to be reprogrammed (with a JTAG programmer) through a single JTAG port, with a switch to select which device should be programmed.

Designed for Buckeye Current's RW-3x in April 2016.
